The relationship between “product” and “product_category” entities is a one-to-many relationship. This means that one product category can have many products, but each product can belong to only one product category. For example, a product category named “Books” can have many products like “Harry Potter”, “The Lord of the Rings”, “The Da Vinci Code”, etc. But each product can only have one category, such as “Books”, “Electronics”, “Clothing”, etc.

The way this relationship is represented in the diagram is by using a foreign key. A foreign key is an attribute that references another attribute in a different entity. In this case, the “category_id” attribute in the “product” entity is a foreign key that references the “id” attribute in the “product_category” entity. This means that the value of the “category_id” attribute in each product record must match the value of the “id” attribute in one of the product category records. This way, the database can link each product to its corresponding category.
