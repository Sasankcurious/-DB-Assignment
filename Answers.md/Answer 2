To ensure that each product in the “product” table has a valid category assigned to it, you could implement a foreign key constraint that references a “category” table. This would ensure that every category ID in the “product” table corresponds to a valid category ID in the “category” table.

Based on the image , it seems that you have already done this by connecting the ‘category_id’ field of the “product” table to the ‘id’ field of the “product_category” table. This is a good practice to maintain data integrity and avoid orphan records.
